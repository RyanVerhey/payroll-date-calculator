Payroll Date Calculator
=======================

This is a script that calculates payroll dates for one year in the future. This is being done as a code challenge for Wowzers.

### Installation
If you want to install this script on a Mac, open Terminal and enter the following text:
```
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/RyanVerhey/payroll-date-calculator.git
cd payroll-date-calculator
```
And that's it!

### Running the Script
Running the script is easy. Once you've installed it, in the same Terminal window, enter:
```
ruby run_script.rb
```
Then follow the instructions. If you need help, you can type <code>help</code> at any time.

### Running Tests
If you want to run my RSpec tests for this script, simply enter this in Terminal in the same directory the script is installed in:
```
rspec .spec.rb
```
